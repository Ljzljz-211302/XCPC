The specific values in the permutation are not important. We focus on the partial order relationship between the a-value of the current LCA node u and its subtrees. This is equivalent to selecting a split point as a[u], designating certain subtrees such that all their a-values are strictly less than a[u], while others are strictly greater than a[u]. The values that can be composed from subtree sizes will contribute to the current node u, and we take the maximum among these contributions to accumulate into the global answer (ans). The set of achievable composed values can be computed using bitsets or 0-1 knapsack techniques.
